Reenewed Life Fellowship

a simple mobile app that links the online media of the organisation together.
A church website is nowadays not the primary focus point of its members so its main function is as a reference point for non members. 
This app enable mobile device users to call, email, locate using Google Maps and connect to the website and uses embedded links to Youtube resources that are likely to be of interest/benefit to users.

Future enhancements will be push notifications, member registration and payments.
